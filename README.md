# react-portfolio

## Description

This is my personal protfolio, now made with React! I originally wanted to utilize an older style of webpage called Frutiger Aero in my design elements, however I switches paths halfway through to attempt to emulate the old Xbox 360 "Blades" UI. However, it became pretty evident that the Blades UI is not made for mouse/keyboard/smartphone users, and is really only meant for console use. So, I took what was left and made the current stacked folder UI.

## Installation

You can view my portfolio through (most) modern browsers, mobile support will be coming down the pipeline soon.
